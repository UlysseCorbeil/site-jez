To help me cope with it, I started factually recording every day of my life in 2012. Making my time physical, something that could be touched, that had a texture, a weight, made more sense to me. Eventually, I became even more obsessed with the physical attributes of the book itself than with the memories it contained. ",

The water received the benediction of the priest of my favorite Cathedral only after I confessed my complete lack of Christian modesty. He told me I shouldn't pursue modesty, and blessed us, my water and me."
